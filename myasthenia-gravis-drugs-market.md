<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Myasthenia Gravis Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anticholinesterases</li><li>Immunosuppressants</li><li>Intravenous Immune Globulins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Myasthenia Gravis drugs market is categorized into three main types: Anticholinesterases, Immunosuppressants, and Intravenous Immune Globulins (IVIG). Anticholinesterases, such as pyridostigmine, enhance communication between nerves and muscles by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine. Immunosuppressants, including corticosteroids and other agents, reduce the immune system's activity to prevent it from attacking the neuromuscular junction. IVIG provides passive immunity by delivering pooled antibodies, offering rapid relief from symptoms during exacerbations.</p></p>
